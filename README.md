### Public
The `public/` directory is for static assets that *are not touched by astro.* This includes images or static scripts that you don't want compiled. 
### Src
The `src/` directory holds all of the project files that Astro compiles.
#### Assets

##### Scripts
This project is using **vanilla JavaScript**. This directory holds `.js` files that can be imported into pages or components with a standard `<script>` tag.
##### Styles
This project is using **vanilla css**. This directory holds all of the `.css` files. The page layout components import the `index.css` which imports all other stylesheets. Global variables (css custom properties) are held in `variables.css`. **Do not edit the global variables.** Specific variables are stored in each file and inherit from the parent variables. 

***Style sheets should not reference variables outside of their own files.*** This way you always know the location of the variable if you need to change it - and it will not affect other elements. If you want to assign `var(--padding-2)` to the `.card` class - create a `--card-padding: var(--padding-2)` variable in the `:root` element of the `components.css` file and use that.
#### Components

#### Layouts

##### Sections

#### Pages




Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
